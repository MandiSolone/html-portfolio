<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Welcome to my corner of the web! I'm thrilled to have you here. Let me introduce myself: I'm Mandi Solone, a budding full stack web developer with a passion for crafting digital experiences that are both functional and beautiful.
</p>
<p>Beyond the lines of code, I'm a dedicated family person. They're my rock, my inspiration, and my biggest supporters. When I'm not busy crafting websites or debugging code, you can often find me spending quality time with my loved ones, whether it's a cozy movie night at home or a fun-filled day out exploring new places.
</p>
<p>And speaking of family, I can't forget to mention my four-legged friends. My dogs bring endless joy and laughter into my life, and they're always there to brighten my day with their boundless energy and unconditional love.
</p>
<p>When I'm not immersed in the world of web development, you'll likely find me soaking up the sun at the beach. There's something about the sound of crashing waves and the feel of warm sand between my toes that instantly puts me at ease. It's my happy place, where I go to recharge and find inspiration.
</p>
<p>Photography is another passion of mine. Capturing moments frozen in time allows me to express my creativity and perspective in a way that words sometimes can't. Whether I'm behind the lens snapping shots of breathtaking landscapes or capturing candid moments with loved ones, photography is my creative outlet and a constant source of joy.
</p>
<p>But let's get back to the tech side of things! As a full stack web developer, I bring a diverse set of skills to the table. From front-end development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to back-end development with Node.js and databases like MongoDB, I thrive on bringing ideas to life in the digital realm. With a keen eye for design and a knack for problem-solving, I'm constantly pushing myself to learn and grow in this ever-evolving field.
</p>
<p>So take a look around, and feel free to reach out if you have any questions or just want to say hello. I'm excited to share my journey with you and to see where this exciting path in web development takes me next!
